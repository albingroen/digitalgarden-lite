I've been using Tailwind CSS on different projects for about a year now. In the
beginning, I didn't like it. I ran into a couple of issues, felt the
frustration of learning a new API and didn't really see the benefits it was
supposed to bring.

I kept going back to it though, and each time I found that some little kink had
been resolved. Also, after learning the class names I got really fast with
Tailwind. Today, I use Tailwind CSS for more or less every project I build. I
have run into some opposition when trying to introduce it at work though, which
certainly is understandable since you shouldn't just implement completely new
technology just because someone thinks it's cool.

Now, what many think after playing around with Tailwind for a little bit is
that the USP would be that you keep the CSS close to the markup, or that fact
that it uses utility classes. I don't actually think this is the biggest win
though. Sure, it's nice to have it coupled so closely to the HTML since you
then don't run into the append-only mode which you often do when de-coupling
the CSS from HTML.

I think the actual win here is the built-in design system that Tailwind comes
with. Initially, you might not really even see this, since it's not
particularly highlighted in their own descriptions or documentation. But, when
you start to think about it, the colors, spacing, fonts, font sizes, and
shadows aren't just picked out randomly, but very carefully thought through by
some really talented designers at Tailwind.

## Colors

Here, you can see how perfectly thought out these colors are. Coming to this
conclusion by yourself might take weeks or months of work. With Tailwind, you
get all of these out of the box, for every sort of relevant CSS property.

## Typography

The same goes for the typography system. I've worked on many web projects where
this has been a great challenge. Building a system like this requires a lot of
research on what sizing scale to use, and how to set everything up. Here, you
get a typography system right out of the box that you can use with ease, and
without having the doubtful thought in the back of your mind whether the system
is actually good or not.

## Shadow

The box shadows are also purposely designed to give you a set of different
shadows for every occasion that look good together in an application. This is
also a property that is very tiresome to set up and be sure that works well
together.

Now, of course, you could set up all of these yourself using CSS variables or
something. This is what I did before I used Tailwind. It's going to take a long
time though, and if you're not an experience designer, you probably can't be a
hundred percent sure the system holds up in all scenarios and work well on all
sort of screens.
