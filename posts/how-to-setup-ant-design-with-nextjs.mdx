In this article we'll be covering how to make Ant Design with custom theming work flawlessly together with Next.js. Start by setting up your Next.js project.

```shell
yarn create next-app my-next-app
```

## TypeScript

Now let's quickly also set up Typescript. This is done by simply renaming your index file from index.js to index.tsx, and adding a couple of dependencies.

```shell
mv pages/index.js pages/index.tsx
```

<br />

```shell
yarn add -D typescript @types/react @types/node
```

## Ant Design

Now, let's install the necessary packages to get Ant Design with custom theming working.

```shell
yarn add antd next-plugin-antd-less@^0.3.0 babel-plugin-import
```

After installing these dependencies, we need to add some content to a _next.config.js_ file. If it doesn't already exist, go ahead and create it, at the root of the project. Add the following content.

```javascript
// next.config.js

const withAntdLess = require("next-plugin-antd-less");

module.exports = withAntdLess({
  lessVarsFilePath: "./styles/antd.less",
  webpack(config) {
    return config;
  },
});
```

Now, as you see in the code snippet above, we're pointing to a less file that should contain all the custom Ant Design variables. This file currently does not exist, so we need to add it. Go ahead and create a new _antd.less_ file in the _styles_ directory. Also, go ahead and add a couple of variables, so we have something to test with.

```less
# styles/antd.less

@primary-color: #477593;
@border-radius-base: 5px;
@body-background: #f7f7f7;
```

The last thing we need to do is to set up a custom babel configuration. This is fairly easy and just requires you to add a couple of lines to a _.babelrc.js_ file, which you can also create if it doesn't already exist.

```javascript
// .babelrc.js

module.exports = {
  presets: [["next/babel"]],
  plugins: [["import", { libraryName: "antd", style: true }]],
};
```

Now you should be all good to go. Start the dev server by running

```shell
yarn dev
```

And then add a couple of components in the index file to make sure everything works.

```javascript
import { Button } from "antd";

export default function Home() {
  return <Button type="primary">Custom button</Button>;
}
```

If the button now shows up in a green color instead of a blue one, the implementation is successful. If something did not work, try upgrading or downgrading to different versions of _next-plugin-antd-less_ or _babel-plugin-import_. Thanks for reading!
