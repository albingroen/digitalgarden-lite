After working at the fintech company, Dooer, for soon to be 2 years, I've
decided to take the next step in my career. I've worked on a lot of interesting
projects at Dooer, building tools that help business owners manage their
financials through their cellphone. I've learned to work in organized teams and
implementing features from a specification, writing tests, and building
infrastructure. I am really grateful for the people I've gotten to meet, the
code I've written, and the business owners I've helped throughout these 2
years.

Now it's time for something new though. At Dooer, when I started, we were about
35 people. Since I started back in 2019 we've almost doubled, as well as gone
remote. This is something that's been really challenging, and I've felt the
need to go back to a smaller, more tight nit company again. Before I joined
Dooer, I worked at a small startup called Wopify. We built a recruiting service
where we'd match candidates with job postings, through tags (or AI in
marketing terms). This company didn't succeed though, and that's when I made
the switch to Dooer.

Around a year ago I came across this company called Demando, it seemed like a
pretty humble business in my eyes, and the customers listed on their front page
got me interested. I signed up for an account, and since then I've been
passively receiving offers from interesting companies. Recently though, Demando
actually reached out themselves through their own platform, wondering if I'd be
interested in joining their team in Stockholm, to work on their product. After
talking with a couple of people at the company I quickly felt that this could
be a nice place to work at. I felt a genuine connection with the team members,
as well as leadership.

Today was my last day at Dooer. 3 months ago I handed in my resignation, and
now I'm taking 2 months of well-deserved summer vacation to load up energy
before I start at Demando in August. I'm really thrilled to be joining a
smaller team again (8 people), since you get to have more impact, greater
creativity, and a bigger say in what and how things get built. My goal is
to eventually also make the physical move to Stockholm, so if you or anybody
you know is looking to rent out or sell an apartment, please hit me up on

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!
