Ryan’s background as a musician taught him many lessons that would eventually apply to his current career. As a musician, he learned about composition, sales, and even programming so he could build his band a website.

Ryan also had an actual sales job where he learned that you can do something so well that you’ll be unable to do it anymore. In sales that meant being good at generating leads which lead to a lot of clients which lead to ceasing to generate leads. But, that eventually lead to you have no clients because you let your stream of leads dry up.

It’s easy to become so narrowly focused on what’s in front of you that you get blindsided by what’s coming down the pipeline 6 months from now.

React changed the front-end landscape. We went from having a mutation-based approach to a functional approach. But, React has made it so easy to write code that we are forgetting our fundamentals. React websites are becoming bloated.

Remix’s goal is to bring back the Web 1.0 ways of doing things that lead to lean, performant websites. It’s Web 1.0 that is progressively enhanced with React and React Router.

“The technology that sticks, and wins, is the technology that can sneak its way into your existing stack because no one wants to rewrite!” Remix is built on this philosophy, allowing you to incrementally incorporate Remix into your existing application.

# What are abstraction levels?

### Ryan Florence:

Well, I was reading an article by Korn, when I was a teenager, a long time ago, and they said that Korn, the band name is not cool as just a name. It's the band that makes it cool. I wasn't really somebody who listened to Korn, but they always say that, you pick the name that you hate the least. You're never going to your band name, so just pick the one you hate the least. So, we were all sitting around trying to decide on a band name, and I don't know why it was sitting around in our drummer's basement, where we practiced, they had a David Letterman, I don't know if it was in a magazine, I don't even know anymore, but you had a top 10 list that David Letterman would always do.
