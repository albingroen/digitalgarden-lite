So in this article, I thought I would go through how you can use two really
good technologies in order to build a very modern, flexible, fast, and
easy-to-use serverless web application. Our frontend in this case will be
provided and built using the relatively new frontend framework, Svelte & Svelte
Kit. You can look at SvelteKit like kind of the Svelte version of React's
Next.js.

The backend for this application will be provided by SvelteKit's serverless
endpoints feature. This means that you can simply create a JavaScript or
TypeScript file inside of `src/routes`, and then you can hit this endpoint in
order to submit, update, get, or delete data (which can live inside of
database, since the logic is run server-side).

## Getting started

To set up our project, we need to start by creating a new SvelteKit
application. This can be done really easily by running this command in your
terminal. Note that this article focuses on people using Macs, but most of the
functionality should be available on Windows & Linux as well.

```shell
npm init svelte@next my-svelte-prisma-app
```

After running this, you should see a new folder called `my-svelte-prisma-app`.

## Setting up Prisma

Now it's time to set up Prisma. Prisma is a set of tools that you can use to
set up and manage your database functionality for your application. To start
off, run this command in your terminal to install the needed packages and
generate the necessary files for using Prisma.

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm install prisma @prisma/client
```

### Generate Prisma files

```shell
npx prisma init
```

This will set up some new files in the directory for you.

- `.env`
- `prisma/`
  - `schema.prisma`
  - `migrations`

## Database

To start off, you need to provide a URL to your database for Prisma to be able
to run its migrations. To do this, open up the `.env` file and update the
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable to be a valid URL to a database somewhere.
This can either (for now) be a database running on your local machine, or one
that's hosted somewhere on the internet. Just make sure the database type is
one of these ones.

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL="URL TO YOUR DATABASE"
```

### Create your first model

To create a new model for your database, you can go ahead and open the
`prisma/prisma.schema` file. Here you can define your first model. To do this,
you simply just use the `model` keyword, give it a name, and then define which
fields you want your model to have. Here I just want to give a shoutout the
[Prisma Schema Builder](https://prismabuilder.io), which is an app where you
visually can build out your schema, and not have to write it yourself. But, if
you still want to do that - a model can look something like this. To learn more
about the Prisma schema language, you can read more about it
[here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema).

```Prisma
datasource db {
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  provider = "postgresql"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id       String  @id @unique @default(uuid())
  email    String  @unique
  password String
  name     String
  phone    String  @unique
  age      Int
}
```

### Creating & running migrations

To apply your schema to your database, you need to run a command that looks
like this. This will go ahead and first create a SQL migration and put it inside
of the `prisma/migrations` folder. Then, it will go ahead and try to apply the
migration against your database, for which URL you specified in the
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable. So, if that URL isn't correct, your
migration will fail.-

```shell
npx prisma migrate dev --name="A NAME OF THE MIGRATION"
```

### Generating the Prisma client

Now comes the really cool part with Prisma. At this point, we've created our
model, generated a migration, and applied it to our database. If we'd go ahead
and look inside of our database, we would see a table called User with the
columns we specified in the schema file. Now comes the ORM part of Prisma,
which you can use to actually query the database, instead of having to write
raw SQL commands. To do this we can run this command.

```shell
npx prisma generate
````

## Serverless endpoints

Now that we've got our database all set up, and an ORM to query it, we can start
creating the serverless endpoints we want for our application. And, to do this,
we can simply add JavaScript or TypeScript files into `src/routes`.

Inside of the files we can then export asynchronous functions which are named
after the HTTP method we want to account for. So for example, if we want to a
POST endpoint /users. We can create a file that looks like this.

`src/routes/users/index.js`

```javascript
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export async function post(req, res) {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: req.body
  });

  return {
    body: user
  }
};
```

Now, if you go ahead and send a `POST` request to
`http://localhost:3000/users`, and send the relevant data along as the `body`
parameter, a new user should be created inside of the database table.

## Frontend (Svelte)

Now that we've got a basic SvelteKit endpoint set up for creating a new user,
we can add a form to try out this functionality. To do so, we can update the
`src/routes/index.js` to look something like this. With that code, all saved and
ready to go, filling out the form and then clicking the button, should, in
theory, submit the data to the serverless endpoint and run create a new user.

```svelte
<script>
  let password;
  let email;
  let phone;
  let name;
  let age;

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    fetch("/users", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        password,
        email,
        phone,
        name,
        age
      })
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(res => console.log(res))
    .catch(() => alert('Failed to submit'))
  }
</script>

<form on:submit|preventDefault|stopPropagation={handleSubmit}>

  <input bind:value={email} type="email" required />
  <input bind:value={password} type="password" required />
  <input bind:value={name} required />
  <input bind:value={phone} type="tel" required />
  <input bind:value={age} type="number" required />

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Hosting

Hosting a SvelteKit app is quite easy to do on most platforms. One thing you
have to do at this point though, is you have to set up an adapter for the
hosting provider you're going to use. So, for example, if you want to host on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com), you have to use the
[adapter-vercel](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-vercel)
adapter. You can read more about this
[here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters).

## Wrapping up

Now you should have a pretty good idea of how you can use Svelte & Prisma in
order to create a web application that uses serverless endpoints to create,
update, fetch and delete data from a database.
