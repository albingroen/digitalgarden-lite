Prisma is a really nice set of packages that help you write your database and
API functionality. VSCode has a Prisma extension that help you format your
schema files appropriately. If you're using Vim, you can actually still achieve
this functionality with a couple of plugins. First, you're going to need some
sort of plugin manager for Vim in order to install third party plugins from the
community. In my case, I use Neovim together with vim-plug.

## Install vim-plug with Neovim

```shell
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
```

And then add this to the top of your `nvim.init` file

```VimScript
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" List plugins here

call plug#end()
```

## Language Servers

In order to get Prisma autocompletion in Vim, the easiest way to get started is
by using `coc.nvim` and installing a couple of coc plugins. Start by adding
this to the plugins and then sourcing the file, and then running `PlugInstall`
from the Vim command line.

```VimScript
" Code intellisense / autocompletion
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}

" Prisma syntax highlighting
Plug 'pantharshit00/vim-prisma'
```

Then you simply need to run the following command to install the Prisma plugin for coc

```Vim-Command
:CocInstall coc-prisma
```

## Result

### Syntax highlighting

### Linting

### Formatting

If you want to format the Prisma file, you can simply run the `:Format` command from within Vim. If you instead want to auto-format the file on save, you can add this to the coc config file (that you can open by running `:CocConfig`).

```json
{
  "coc.preferences.formatOnSaveFiletypes": ["prisma"]
}
```

## Closing

Using this setup you can quite comfortably write Prisma code inside of Vim,
where you can get syntax highlighting, format the code, and get built-in
linting. If you like this sort of content, consider following me on
